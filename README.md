# WildialApp - Wildlife Intrusion Detection Mobile Application  

A Flutter-based mobile application that integrates with the [Wildlife Detection Python Module](https://github.com/naeemudheenp/WIldlife-detection) to detect wildlife intrusions and send live warnings, ensuring timely alerts for enhanced safety and conservation efforts.

## Description  

**WildialApp** is a comprehensive solution for detecting wildlife intrusions in real-time. The application serves as the mobile interface for the Python-based [Wildlife Detection Module](https://github.com/naeemudheenp/WIldlife-detection), enabling seamless communication and live alerts for potential intrusions.  

### Features  
- **Integration with Python Module**: Connects directly with the Wildlife Detection Python module for real-time data processing.  
- **Live Alerts**: Sends instant warnings to users when wildlife intrusion is detected.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an intuitive interface for monitoring and managing alerts.  
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Built with Flutter, ensuring compatibility with both Android and iOS devices.  

### How It Works  
1. The Python module processes live data (e.g., camera feeds or sensor inputs) to detect wildlife intrusions.  
2. Once detected, the information is sent to the **WildialApp**, which displays the alert to the user.  
3. Users receive a live warning notification, enabling timely action to mitigate risks.  

This project is ideal for wildlife conservationists, forest departments, and individuals living in areas prone to wildlife intrusions. By combining the power of machine learning and mobile technology, **WildialApp** ensures safety and conservation go hand in hand.
